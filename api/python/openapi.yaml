      description: |
        Get sensors for a set of devices. The response will contain the latest sensor values for the devices.
        The sensor values are updated depending on the device types sampling rate.
        It is recommended to poll the API at a regular interval to get the latest sensor values.
        The response will be paginated with a maximum of 50 records per page.
